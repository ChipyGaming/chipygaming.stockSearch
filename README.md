Stock Search

The main purpose of this project is to allow the user to read up on stocks on any website, and allowing them to go to a financial site (in this case financial yahoo) and view more information on that stock.
I came up with this idea as I was reading some things on Twitter about a bunch of different stocks. I hated having to look up each stock individually to view the price movement that the tweet was talking about. With this, I can now just click on the google extension, which will pull up all stocks mentionted on the page I am currently viewing, and then select the stock that I want to see more information on.

FUTURE IDEAS:
[] Add feature to save stock to source (to be able to go back and look at the tweet/site/article/etc that I saw the stock on
[] Add feature to filter stocks, so that I can view the ones that I care about instead of every stock
[] Sometimes app picks up words from the page that are not stocks, try to make it more specific
